# Blackjack using Reinforcement Learning

The aim of this project is to produce a Blackjack strategy using decaying epsilon-greedy Q-learning that will earn more than the average casino player.

All the code is in the notebook [`blackjack.ipynb`](https://github.com/Pradhyo/blackjack/blob/master/blackjack.ipynb).
